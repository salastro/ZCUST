\begin{exercise}\,\\
    A small object moves along the $x$-axis with acceleration $a_x(t)=-(.0320)(15-t)$. At $t=0$ the object is at $x=-14$ and has velocity $v_0x=6.20$.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Find the position of the object at $t=15$.
        \item Find the velocity of the object at $t=15$.
        \item Find the acceleration of the object at $t=15$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
