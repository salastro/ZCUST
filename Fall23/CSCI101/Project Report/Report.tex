\begin{abstract}
  The Ray Reflection Simulation addresses challenges in comprehending the
  principles of ray reflection in geometric optics. Developed in Python using
  the Turtle graphics library, ReflectoRay offers an interactive and
  configurable platform for users to visualize and experiment with real-time
  reflections off mirrors. Through a JSON file, users can specify initial
  conditions, including mirror positions, source locations, and ray angles. The
  project's significance lies in its potential to enhance the learning
  experience, engage users in dynamic simulations, and contribute practically
  to the understanding of geometric optics. ReflectoRay allows users to save
  simulations as images or videos, fostering documentation and collaborative
  learning, making it a valuable tool for educational purposes.

\section{Usage Manual}

\subsection{System Requirements}
Before using the Ray Reflection Simulation, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Python 3.x installed
    \item Required Python libraries: Turtle, OpenCV, PIL, Rich
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Installation}

\subsubsection{Installing Python}
If Python is not already installed on your system, you can download it from the official Python website (\url{https://www.python.org/downloads/}).

\subsubsection{Installing Required Libraries}
Install the necessary Python libraries using the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
pip install turtle opencv-python pillow rich
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Running the Simulation}

\subsubsection{Clone the Repository}
Clone the Ray Reflection Simulation repository from the project's GitHub page:

\begin{verbatim}
git clone https://github.com/salastro/reflectoray
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Navigate to the Project Directory}
Enter the project directory:

\begin{verbatim}
cd ReflectoRay
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Configuring the Simulation}

Edit the configuration JSON file (`initial\_conditions.json`) to define the initial conditions of the simulation. Specify mirror positions, source locations, initial angles of rays, and other parameters as needed.

The configuration file is structured as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
{
  "mirrors": [
    [[100, -100], [100, 100]],
    [[100, 100], [-100, 100]]
  ],
  "sources": [
    {"start": [0, 0], "color": "black"},
    {"start": [-50, 50], "color": "red"}
  ],
  "angles": {
    "start": 0,
    "end": 360,
    "step": 10
  },
  "iterations": 100
}
\end{verbatim}

The `mirrors` array contains the coordinates of the endpoints of each mirror. Each mirror is represented as a list of two points, where each point is a list of two numbers representing the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the point.

The `sources` array contains the coordinates of the starting points of each ray.
Each ray is represented as a dictionary with two keys: `start` and `color`. The
`start` key contains a list of two numbers representing the $x$ and $y$
coordinates of the starting point of the ray. The `color` key contains a string
representing the color of the ray, which can be any well-known color name or a
hexadecimal color code.

The `angles` dictionary contains the starting angle, ending angle, and step size
for the rays. The `start` key contains a number representing the starting angle
of the rays. The `end` key contains a number representing the ending angle of
the rays. The `step` key contains a number representing the step size between
each ray.

The `iterations` key contains a number representing the number of iterations to
run the simulation for.

\subsubsection{Run the Simulation}

Execute the following command to run the simulation:

\begin{verbatim}
python reflectoray.py
\end{verbatim}

Help information can be displayed by passing the `--help` flag to the command:

\begin{verbatim}
python reflectoray.py --help
\end{verbatim}

which will display the following output:

\begin{verbatim}
usage: reflectoray.py [-h] [-i [IMAGE]] [-v [VIDEO]] [initial_conditions]

Ray Reflection Simulation

positional arguments:
  initial_conditions    Path to the initial conditions file (default:
                        initial_conditions.json)

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i [IMAGE], --image [IMAGE]
                        Save the simulation as a png image
  -v [VIDEO], --video [VIDEO]
                        Record the simulation as a video
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Save the Simulation}

The simulation can be saved as a static image (PNG) or as a video (MP4). To save
the simulation as an image, pass the `--image` flag to the command:

\begin{verbatim}
python reflectoray.py --image
\end{verbatim}

To save the simulation as a video, pass the `--video` flag to the command:

\begin{verbatim}
python reflectoray.py --video
\end{verbatim}
